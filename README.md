This is my presentation for the Assessment Coordinator job interview, addressing the following:

1. Scenario Question: You are working for the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science coordinating the process to assess the development and competence of undergraduate students across 10 engineering programs. One of the requirements is to assess the degree to which students demonstrate communication skills, individual and teamwork skills, and lifelong learning, as described in the [CEAB accreditation guidelines in Section](http://www.engineerscanada.ca/sites/default/files/2014_accreditation_criteria_and_procedures_v06.pdf)
 
	Please describe an efficient and reliable process to do this, including what information you would propose to gather, analysis you would conduct, and how you would propose to work with departments to improve the quality of the process and our programs.

2. Portfolio (10 minutes): Please present a summary of assessment work you have performed, ideally including examples of collaborations with students and faculty, data collection, analysis, and reporting/follow-up.
